## Introduction ##
QMagen is a package for the finite-temperature many-body simulations and an advanced tool for thermal data analysis of magnetic quantum materials.
### many-body sovlers ###
* Exact diagonalization (ED, as a high-T solver)
* Linearized tensor renormalization group (LTRG, as a full-T solver for 1D spin chain)
* Exponential tensor renormalization group (XTRG, as a full-T solver for 2D system)
